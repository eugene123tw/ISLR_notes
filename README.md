Notes for "A Introduction to Statistical Learning" and "The Elements of Statistical Learning".  
I try to proof the theories and explain the concept which are not included in the books.  
I make mistakes. So, if you found one, please inform me.  
"Writing is nature's way of letting you know how sloppy your thinking is" - Dick Guindon.  
Making notes is the way of letting me know how lousy my thinking is.
